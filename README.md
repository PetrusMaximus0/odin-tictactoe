## AI opponent

The game features an AI opponent which employs an adversarial search algorithm called [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves), making the game un-winnable for the player. 

**If for some reason you are able to defeat the AI, then there is a bug in the algorithm.** Give it a try.
